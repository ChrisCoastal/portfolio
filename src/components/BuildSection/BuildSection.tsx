            I like making nice stuff with nice stuff. Employing a core of
            industry standard tools interleaved with a continually expanding
            selection of what is new / trendy / exciting / best-suited, I create
            expressive Front End UI that works to balance elements of design and
            process. supported by a core of industry standard tools. Sewn
            together with creativity and care to content that is engaging and
            accessible.
