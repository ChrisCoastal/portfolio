            I like making nice stuff with nice stuff. Employing a core of
            industry standard tools like React, Typescript, and Tailwind
            interleaved with a continually expanding selection of what is new /
            trendy / exciting / best-suited, I design and develop expressive
            Front End UI that works to balance elements of usabillity,
            creatvity, and aesthetics.
