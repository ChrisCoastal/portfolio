With a pre-existing site built on Squarespace 7.0, Jaime had designed some minor layout changes and a new landing page that wasn't possible with the basic Squarespace CMS and her site's template.",
    "Though I've built a few Squarespace sites over the years, Squarespace isn't really in my wheelhouse or focus, so this was a chance to dive in and learn a bit more about it. While fairly inflexible out of the box, Squarespace 7.0 templates are customizable via a 'Developer Mode' and writing JSON-T, Squarespace's in-house templating language. The templating language is very flexible, but with the tradeoff (especially for simple content) that it requires writing a bit more code to do a bit less than plain HTML and CSS.",

    "The end result, building on top of the existing theme Studio A was using, replicated Jamieâ€™s design brief and added functionality to the CMS so that the new landing page's content could be easily edited by the Studio A team moving forward. The small updates to page layouts I made are live while the landing page waits for Jamie to launch the new 'studio work' section of her site.",
