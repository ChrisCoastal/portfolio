My breadth of experience gives me great versatility as a creative who not only knows their stuff visually and contextually, but also how to implement it technically and cooperatively.',

This builds upon previous experience going back 10 years working in freelance web design and illustration, receiving a BFA degree in printmaking and digital design, and proudly holding the position of Media Coordinator for the internationally recognized design studio, molo, in Vancouver.',
